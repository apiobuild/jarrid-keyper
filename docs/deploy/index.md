The Deploy module implements the [Terraform Cloud Development Kit](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cdktf){:target="_blank"} underneath. It scans existing key configs generated by the [key module](../crypto-key/index.md) and programmatically constructs Terraform providers and resources accordingly.

This gives you the flexibility to use KMS on any cloud provider and custom Vault of your choice, such as [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/){:target="_blank"}, without additional implementation, as these KMS providers all come with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/){:target="_blank"} providers already implemented.

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/){:target="_blank"} allows you to deploy, track, and audit deployment state, integrated into most CI/CD pipelines very easily.

## Demo
