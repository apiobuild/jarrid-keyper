[Keyper](https://github.com/jarrid-xyz/keyper/) by [Jarrid](https://jarrid.xyz) is a suite of crypto key
management APIs to simplify key creation, management, deployment, encryption/decryption in a standardized and secure
way. Operations are file-based and can be easily automated, tracked, audited, and managed via file-based processes such
as [GitOps](https://github.com/topics/gitops). Fully integrated with cloud KMS services such
as [AWS KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms) or [GCP KMS](https://cloud.google.com/kms), leverage managed crypto key
generation and reduce infrastructure maintenance burden.
